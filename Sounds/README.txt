Please place your .ogg or .wav sound files in this directory.

Rename them exactly as follows to match the code:
- Backstab.ogg
- Gouge.ogg
- Ambush.ogg
- KidneyShot.ogg
- CheapShot.ogg
- Vanish.ogg

(You can use .wav files if you prefer, but you would need to edit Core.lua to change the extension to .wav)
